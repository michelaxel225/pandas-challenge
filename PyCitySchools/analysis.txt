Based on the results obtained, a couple of conclusions can be made. Students in charter schools tend to do much better than their counterpart in the district schools in both math and reading. in fact, the top five performing schools are all charter schools while the bottom five are all district schools. there seem to also be a correlation between school size and performance. smaller schools tend to do much better than larger schools. a shocking conclusion however is the fact that more spending on a student does not equal to a better performance. results showed that the more a school spent money on students, the less these students would perform. there also seem to be no major correlation between performance and grade. students performed similarly regardless of their grade. another observation from these results is that students tend to do better in reading.
